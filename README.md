# Working with Autoregressive Modeling
Consider the Daily Temperatures dataset from Australia. This is a dataset for a forecasting task. That is, given temperatures up to date (or period) T, design a forecasting (autoregressive) model to predict the temperature on date T+1. You can refer to link 1, link 2 for more information on autoregressive models. Use linear regression as your autoregressive model. Plot the fit of your predictions vs the true values and report the RMSE obtained. A demonstration of the plot is given below.
